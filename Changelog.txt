Thoughts:
Pre war		---- pre war focus tree too long?
Historical democratic path --- convert Great Depression recovery to mission/decision system rather than foci.
Axe or find purpose for economic mobilisation focus.
Non-tank version of Army priority? Repurpose commandos focus methinks.
Is the commonwealth aircraft company nat spirit used by anything right now?
Bombers and para tech seem kinda useless.
Military Industrial focus seems kinda lazy
